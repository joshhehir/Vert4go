# Description 

Vertago is a competitive First-person movement based game with a primary focus on speed, and verticality. The aim is to place 3 tags as high as you can while trying to remove your opponent's tags. The height of each of your tags combined gives your final score and it becomes the next person's time to run. Go fast, go high and take risks doing dangerous manoeuvres to put your tags in hard to reach places, snatching that score boost and making it difficult for the next runner to beat you. 

Emboldened by an urban/street theme. With a stylised artstyle along the lines of jet set radio and sludge life among other media with great urban aesthetics. Music will follow suit as high energy tracks will be featured throughout to really capture those urban vibes and enhance the players experience.
